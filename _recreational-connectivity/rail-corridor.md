The Rail Corridor was formerly a railway line that was used for commuting and transporting goods between Singapore and the rest of Malay Peninsula at the beginning of the 20th century. With the return of railway land to Singapore in 2011, the Rail Corridor presented an opportunity as a continuous open space through the heart of Singapore where communities can forge new memories together.
