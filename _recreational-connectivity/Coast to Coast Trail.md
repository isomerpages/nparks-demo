Do you enjoy taking nice long walks in lush greenery, or exploring the outdoor spaces around you? Then visit the Coast-to-Coast (C2C) Trail (Central) for a curated walking experience across the island!

The Coast-to-Coast Trail (Central) is a 36 km trail that spans across Singapore, linking up nature areas, parks and park connectors from **[Jurong Lake Gardens](https://www.nparks.gov.sg/juronglakegardens)** in the west, the new **[Lornie Nature Corridor](https://www.nparks.gov.sg/gardens-parks-and-nature/park-connector-network/lornie-pc)** near the centre, and to [**Coney Island Park**](https://www.nparks.gov.sg/gardens-parks-and-nature/parks-and-nature-reserves/coney-island-park) in the northeast. 

You can choose to explore the Trail on your own using the NParks Explore a Route (NEAR) mobile app or C2C (Central) online Trail Guide.
