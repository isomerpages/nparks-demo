<h2>Eastern Corridor</h2>
<p>The Eastern Corridor is an 18 km route comprising park connectors that
have been progressively completed since it was first announced in 2021.
Half of the route is located along waterways, including those enhanced
under national water agency&nbsp;PUB’s Active, Beautiful, Clean Waters
(ABC Waters) Programme, offering park visitors a scenic cycling experience
along waterscapes in the east. This provides more opportunities for the
community to explore our parks and nature areas. Multi-tiered landscaping
along the Eastern Corridor helps enhance greenery and attract biodiversity.
This will bring the community closer to greenery, enabling them to benefit
from the positive effects of nature on their health and well-being. It
will also connect communities and bring about a sense of space many times
beyond our small island-city state. These efforts contribute to Singapore’s
transformation into a&nbsp; <a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/about-us/city-in-nature" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">City in Nature</a>.</p>
