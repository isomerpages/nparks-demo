The Park Connector Network (PCN) of Singapore is an island-wide network of linear green corridors linking major parks and nature areas across Singapore. With more than 30 km of trails, the PCN presents a diverse palette of recreational green opportunities, provides avid outdoor enthusiasts with enhanced accessibility to nature spaces across the island, and serve to enhance ecological connectivity between our natural habitats.

Feel the cool breeze as you navigate your way along the roads, picturesque rivers and canals that link you to the major parks in Singapore. Hop on a bicycle, put on a pair of rollerblades or simply jog along the park connectors and appreciate the myriad of sensory delights and adventures on offer.
