NParks Explore A Route mobile app is NParks’ augmented reality (AR)-enabled mobile application, an interactive walking experience curated across the 36 km stretch of parks and park connectors.

Learn more about our native biodiversity with the help of AR, check out the interesting sights and attractions along the way, and take part in fun activities and programmes. Through these activities, you can earn points (“flowers”) in the app which will be accumulated to qualify you for special activation events coming up where you can earn much bigger and more attractive gifts!
