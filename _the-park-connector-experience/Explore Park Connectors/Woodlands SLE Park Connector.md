Running along the side of the SLE, the Woodlands (SLE) Park Connector links the Woodlands (Ave 2) Park Connector to the Ulu Sembawang Park Connector.

With “green-roof” shelters and drinking fountains placed along the park connector, visitors can take a breather and enjoy the beauty of the nearby nature reserve.
