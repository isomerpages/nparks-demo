## Old Upper Thomson Park Connector


Located in a rich biodiversity and historical area, Old Upper Thomson Park Connector runs through the&nbsp;the iconic Old Upper Thomson Road which was once used for motor racing during the golden days. Users can enjoy a tranquil walk, filled with flora and fauna while immersing in rich history found at the Upper Peirce Reservoir and&nbsp;Thomson Nature Park.

Biodiversity surveys indicate that animals, including the Raffles’ Banded Langur, frequently move between the Nature Reserve and Thomson Nature Park either via tree canopies, culverts or directly across the Old Upper Thomson Road. Check out the canopy linkages and rope bridges which have been installed along the road to further facilitate the safe movement of the Raffles’ Banded Langur and other arboreal animals.&nbsp;&nbsp;

To make the area even more conducive for nocturnal animals within the Nature Reserve and Nature Park, Old Upper Thomson Road is closed to vehicular traffic between 7.30 pm to 6 am daily.
