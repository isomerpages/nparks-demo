Running alongside the beautiful Central Catchment Nature Reserve, the 5-kilometre-long Mandai Connector links the Ulu Sembawang Park Connector to the Khatib Bongsu Park Connector. It also joins one of Singaporeâ€™s five gazetted Heritage Roads, Mandai Road, (starting opposite Upper Seletar Reservoir Park Carpark and ending at the junction of Mandai Avenue).
