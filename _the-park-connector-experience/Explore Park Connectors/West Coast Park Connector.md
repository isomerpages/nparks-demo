## West Coast Park Connector

Running through residential areas and schools, the West Coast Park Connector links Pandan Reservoir and Pandan Reservoir Fitness Corner with West Coast Park, and leads to Clementi Woods Park. Level and smooth, it is an ideal cycling route for amateur cyclists looking to travel from Pandan Gardens estate to the West Coast estate. Eagles have also been spotted soaring in the skies above this stretch.

With its relatively flat terrain, the West Coast Park Connector is also suitable for leisure joggers seeking a comfortable run or amateur skaters looking to hone their skating skills.
