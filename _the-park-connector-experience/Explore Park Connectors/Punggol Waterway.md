## Punggol Waterway

Built around Singapore's largest man-made waterway, the Punggol Waterway Park Connector is a great place for park users to enjoy a fun-filled day of leisure activities.

Fitness enthusiasts can jog or cycle on the 8.4 km long track along the promenade at both sides of the waterway while admiring the surrounding view. Alternatively, sit on the many benches around and enjoy the breeze as you listen to the soothing sounds of running, trickling, splashing and cascading water. While doing so, look out for the various types of birds that can be spotted along the Waterway.

The Waterway runs through the Punggol Waterway Park, and serves to increase park and water frontage for the housing estate while providing a green respite for residents.The word ‘Punggol’ in Malay means 'hurling sticks at the branches of fruit trees to bring them down to the ground', a reference to the area’s history as a fruit-growing district or as a rendezvous for wholesale fruit agents.
