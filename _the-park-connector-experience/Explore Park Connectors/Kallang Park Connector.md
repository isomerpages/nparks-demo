## Kallang PC

Stretching along the Kallang River, the Kallang Park Connector links Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park to Kallang Riverside Park where you have the chance to see foraging birds, monitor lizards and squirrels along the riverbank. It takes you through several residential estates in the Central region – Bishan, Toa Payoh, Potong Pasir, Serangoon, Bendemeer, Upper Boon Keng and Kallang.

Enjoy the lush greenery at Kolam Ayer Waterfront, part of PUB’s Active, Beautiful, Clean Waters programme, along Kallang River. This park connector also meets Whampoa Park Connector from Bendemeer Road, providing you with easy accessibility to Toa Payoh Town Park

**Kallang River @ Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park**

One of the highlights of the Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park is the stretch of Kallang River that used to run in a concrete canal but is now a naturalised, meandering river teeming with life. The result of a joint collaboration between NParks and PUB, under the latter's Active, Beautiful and Clean Waters (ABC) Programme; this river brings park users closer to the water to enjoy its beauty and serenity, and to appreciate the flora and fauna that flourish in the park because of the waterway.

**Kolam Ayer Waterfront**

Officially opened to the public in 2008, Kolam Ayer ABC Waterfront features a makeover of a 200-metre stretch of the Kallang River. Floating look-out decks and interactive water features such as the Archimedes Screw and Water Wheel allow residents to get closer to the water.
