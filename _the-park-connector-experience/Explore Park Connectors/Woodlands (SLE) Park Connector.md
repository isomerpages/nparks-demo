## Woodlands (SLE) Park Connector

Running along the side of the SLE, the Woodlands (SLE) Park Connector links the Woodlands (Ave 2) Park Connector to the Ulu Sembawang Park Connector.

With “green-roof” shelters and drinking fountains placed along the park connector, visitors can take a breather and enjoy the beauty of the nearby nature reserve.
