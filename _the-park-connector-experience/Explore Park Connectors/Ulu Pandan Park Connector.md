## Ulu Pandan Park Connector

<br>

The Ulu Pandan Park connector runs along both banks of the scenic Sungei Ulu Pandan, between Commonwealth Ave West and Bukit Batok East Ave 2. Visitors can access the park connector from various entrances accessible from Ghim Moh, Holland Grove, Clementi, Sunset, Faber and Bukit Batok East estates.

Keep your eyes and ears peeled for the amazing array of biodiversity which can be observed from the park connector. Try to catch sight of the tall Grey Heron (_Andrea cinerea_) skulking silently in the shallow waters of Sungei Ulu Pandan, waiting for an opportunity to prey on fishes. You might also catch sight of the White-throated Kingfisher (_Halcyon smyrnensis_) swooping down to the water or hear the Common Flameback (_Dinopium javanense_) and Sunda Pygmy Woodpecker (_Dendrocopus moluccensis_) at work.

During the flowering season of Trumpet Tree (_Tabebuia rosea_), the colourful sight of white and pink flowers can be enjoyed. Along the park, there are other flowering trees such as the Pink Mempat (_Cratoxylum formosum_) and Yellow Saraca (_Saraca thaipingensis_).
