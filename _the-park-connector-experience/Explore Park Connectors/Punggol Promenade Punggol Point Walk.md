## Punggol Promenade Punggol Point Walk

Begin your seaside stroll at Punggol Point Park. Once a popular seafood haunt, the site adjacent to Punggol Jetty has now been transformed into an idyllic waterfront destination.

With lookout decks, a sand-filled playground and an event plaza, the park allows you to soak in the laidback coastal atmosphere and take in views of Pulau Ubin and the Johor Straits on a ship-inspired,&nbsp;elevated viewing deck.  
  
You can also dine at the various food and beverage outlets near Punggol Point Park.
