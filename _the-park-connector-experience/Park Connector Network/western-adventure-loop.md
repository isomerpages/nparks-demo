The 20-kilometre Western Adventure Loop links excellent destinations for outdoor activities located across eight parks in western Singapore, including nature parks such as Zhenghua Park, Dairy Farm Nature Park and Bukit Batok Nature Park.

For thrill-seekers and intrepid explorers, the loop provides a dose of adventure like nowhere else on the island. Taking visitors through green corridors, nature reserves, parks and trails, the loop is naturally carved for a variety of outdoor sports and activities including favourites such as jogging, cycling and roller blading, as well as adrenaline pumping pursuits such as mountain biking and rock climbing.

Nature lovers and photographers will also be charmed by the scenic views as well as attractive flora and fauna which characterize this loop. In addition, family-oriented facilities in some parks ensure that no one is left out.

A respite from the monotomy of city life, a journey along the loop is perfect for those who thrive on the spirit of adventure and definitely a welome breath of fresh air for just about anyone.
