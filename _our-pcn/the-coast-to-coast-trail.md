Do you enjoy taking nice long walks in lush greenery, or exploring the outdoor spaces around you? Then visit the Coast-to-Coast (C2C) Trail for a curated walking experience across the island!

The Coast-to-Coast Trail is a 36 km trail that spans across Singapore, linking up nature areas, parks and park connectors from Jurong Lake Gardens in the west, the new Lornie Nature Corridor near the centre, and to Coney Island Park in the northeast. You can choose to explore the Trail on your own using the C2C online Trail Guide or the C2C Mobile App.
