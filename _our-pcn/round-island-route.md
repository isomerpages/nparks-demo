Map of the Round Island Route, including key elements


The Round Island Route (RIR), a continuous 150km park connector, is part of NParks’ overall plans to curate a 360km island-wide network of recreational routes comprising park connectors and trails.

When completed, the Round Island Route will be the longest recreational connection in this network. Besides providing more opportunities for nature-based recreation such as hiking and cycling, it will also help enhance ecological connectivity between natural habitats, thereby strengthening Singapore’s ecological resilience.

These all contribute to Singapore’s transformation into a [City in Nature](https://www.nparks.gov.sg/about-us/city-in-nature), a key pillar in the Singapore Green Plan, which is a national movement to advance sustainable development – to create a green, liveable and sustainable home for all Singaporeans. 

### Round Island Route – Phase 1
The first phase of the Round Island Route was launched on 22 January 2022. Stretching across 75km, it covers the eastern half of Singapore, from Rower’s Bay in the north-east, past the Singapore River to Berlayer Creek in the south. It also makes for the island’s longest recreational connection that encircles Singapore in the east.

Key parks along the route include [Rowers’ Bay](https://www.nparks.gov.sg/gardens-parks-and-nature/parks-and-nature-reserves/lower-seletar-reservoir-park/rowers-bay), [Sengkang Riverside Park](https://www.nparks.gov.sg/gardens-parks-and-nature/parks-and-nature-reserves/sengkang-riverside-park), [Pasir Ris Park](https://www.nparks.gov.sg/gardens-parks-and-nature/park-connector-network/pasir-ris-park), [Changi Beach Park](https://www.nparks.gov.sg/gardens-parks-and-nature/park-connector-network/changi-beach-park) and [East Coast Park](https://www.nparks.gov.sg/gardens-parks-and-nature/park-connector-network/east-coast-park).
