The Round Island Route (RIR) is a continuous 150 km park connector that goes around Singapore. It will complement the existing Park Connector Network, connecting existing natural, cultural, historical and recreational sites and linking communities together. It will provide opportunities for recreational activities such as cycling, skating, jogging and hiking. These connections and activities will enhance our ‘City in Nature’ experience for all residents.

Today, of the 60 km first phase of the RIR, 50 km between Sengkang Riverside Park and Gardens by the Bay is already connected. With the completion of Rower’s Bay and the 3 km to Seletar Aerospace Park, 7 km remains to be linked up. This brings us closer to completing the connectivity along the entire 60 km by 2021  when the public will be able to enjoy more nodes with amenities, widened paths along several sections and enhanced planting to provide shade.

The status of the routes are indicated in the table below.
