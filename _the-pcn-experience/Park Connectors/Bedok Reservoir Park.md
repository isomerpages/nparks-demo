Located in the north of Bedok New Town, Bedok Reservoir Park is popular amongst joggers and water sports enthusiasts in the eastern part of Singapore. A converted sand quarry, the park surrounds the 88-hectare Bedok Reservoir, making it a great place for water activities.

Water sports enthusiasts and adrenaline junkies regularly gather at the park to dragon boat, kayak and wakeboard while anglers cast their rods in hopes of hooking their next big catch. Fitness enthusiasts, schools and organisations conduct regular runs at the parkâ€™s 4.3 km track. Alternatively, sit back, relax and enjoy the scenery from the benches that are conveniently placed throughout the park. Visitors can experience a refreshing sense of tranquility at the floating deck, situated near the Activity Lawn event site, which offers a spectacular view of the reservoir.

With more than 14,000 wetland plants added along the reservoir as part of the Active, Beautiful, and Clean (ABC) Waters Programme, Bedok Reservoir Park features a diverse mix of flora and fauna. A great sanctuary for bird watching, nature lovers can spot swallows playing by the water, little herons wading along the banks of the reservoir and kingfishers diving for their lunch.
