Ang Mo Kio Avenue 8 Linear Park is part of the Ang Mo Kio Walking and Cycling Town. Phase 1 of the linear park is completed and connects people from the Ang Mo Kio MRT Station to Bishan - Ang Mo Kio Park.

About 1km long, it was previously an underused concrete space but is now lined with shrubs and butterfly-attracting plants. There is also a bicycle self-service station for cyclists to carry out basic maintenance on their bikes.  A special feature of this linear park is a large outdoor terrarium across the road from Teck Ghee Primary School. Measuring about 4m long, the terrarium is a microcosm of a rainforest environment, with plants that are representative of the forest understorey, including those that grow on substrates such as barks and trees. This is the first time that a large terrarium is displayed in an outdoor setting.

When the next phase of the linear park is completed, its total length will be about 2.6km long and will connect users from Yio Chu Kang MRT Station to Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park. This linear park connects with existing park connectors along the Central Urban Loop, allowing users to cycle from Yio Chu Kang MRT to the Marina Bay area. The fully completed linear park will also include several activity nodes along the linear park, such as a play and fitness area and commercial spaces. Students from nearby schools will be invited to display their artwork in the park, and community gardeners can play an active role in keeping the area green and vibrant.
