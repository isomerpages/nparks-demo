The 36-kilometre Central Urban Loop encompasses iconic HDB housing estates in the central region of Singapore, including Bishan, Ang Mo Kio, Toa Payoh and Whampoa, and provides direct access to Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park, Kallang Riverside Park and Punggol Park.

The Greenery amid the neighbourhoods provides you with lots of recreational options as well as opportunities to observe a myriad of wildlife up close. Plenty of hawker delights will tempt you to indulge in them.

Get away from the busy city centre and enjoy an idyllic day discovering the charms of different neighbourhoods while traversing from one park to another via the PCN. Try and catch glimpses of the different flora and fauna along the way. The Central Urban Loop promises visitors a memorable adventure.
