Put on your helmet and embark on a journey of fun and pay along the spine of eastern Singapore. Part of the Eastern Coastal loop connects Pasir Ris to East Coast Park - havens of cyclists, runners and rollerblading enthusiasts. If you are really lucky, you might even catch a sporting event in action.

Take your pick of stopovers from the numerous green pockets and parks along the loop, or rest at the various food centres to indulge in a variety of food and beverage options. Cool your feet in the lapping waves at East Coast Park and see for yourself why this is the most popular destination park on the island.
