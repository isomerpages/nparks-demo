A pleasant experience in our parks and Park Connector Network (PCN) requires all of us to be considerate towards one another.

The Government has implemented the Active Mobility Act (AMA), which puts in effect recommendations by the Active Mobility Advisory Panel on cycling and the use of Personal Mobility Devices (PMD) and Power-Assisted Bicycles (PABs).

To ensure our parks and park connectors provide a safe and enjoyable experience for everyone, please note the types of devices permitted on various paths, and to abide by the safety guidelines and onsite signage.
