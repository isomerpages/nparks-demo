A pleasant experience in our parks and Park Connector Network (PCN) requires all of us to be considerate towards one another.

The Government has implemented the [Active Mobility Act (AMA)](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/AMA2017), which puts in effect recommendations by the Active Mobility Advisory Panel on cycling and the use of Personal Mobility Devices (PMD) and Power-Assisted Bicycles (PABs).

To ensure our parks and park connectors provide a safe and enjoyable experience for everyone, please note the types of devices permitted on various paths, and to abide by the safety guidelines and onsite signage.

##### If you are riding a bicycle, motorised PMD or PAB…

**Do:**

*   Ensure that your device is in good condition and in compliance with LTA's regulations.
*   Wear protective gear, such as a helmet, for your own safety.
*   Ride in single file. 
*   Maintain a safe distance from other users.
*   Slow down and give way to other users, especially at crowded or narrow areas, and within Attention Zones (red dotted lines).
*   Remember that pedestrians have the right of way on pedestrian crossings.
*   Observe and comply with “No riding” signs, if any.
*   Keep both hands on the handlebars unless signaling. Signal in good time before you make a change in direction. 
*   Keep your device's lights on when riding at night, to make yourself more visible to other users.

**Do not:**

*   Weave along the track.
*   Overtake others when approaching places such as pedestrian crossings, corners and bends.
*   Cycle/ride your device in areas where it is not permitted.
