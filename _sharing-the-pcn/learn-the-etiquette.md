##   Promoting Graciousness on our PCN!

Since 2021, we have been working with various partners to promote the spirit of graciousness and kindness on our Park Connector Network.

Some of the key PCN etiquette behaviours we hope users can inculcate is to keep a ‘Look Out’ for other PCN users, ‘Give Way’ to slower users and at cross junctions, ‘Slowing Down’ when approaching attention zones and ‘Keeping Left’ when out on the Park Connectors.

As part of our PCN Etiquette Campaign, we collaborated with Singapore Kindness Movement (SKM) to launch our inaugural PCN Kindness Campaign in 2022.

We have also installed over 300 PCN etiquette banners islandwide and published a PCN article with The Smart Local in 2022.

We hope all users will stay gracious and courteous, and keep a look out for our PCN etiquette messages when you are on our Park Connector Network!
