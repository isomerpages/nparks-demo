We advise park users to stay on their designated paths. In our parks and along our park connectors, you will encounter these types of paths:

Shared Path

This is shared by all park users, with a maximum speed of 25km/hr. You may see the path being flanked by red continuous or dotted lines (when users approach an Attention Zone).

Segregated / Separated Path

At some locations, there are dedicated paths for various PCN users:

Footpaths - for pedestrians, cyclists and personal mobility aid users travelling at slower speeds (not more than 10km/h). Motorised PMDs and PABs are not allowed on the footpath.
Cycling path – for PMD users and cyclists travelling at higher speeds. This path is flanked by continuous or dotted lines (when users approach an Attention Zone) in red, and feature “PCN” imprints or cyclist icons.

Attention Zones

Segregated paths may merge into ‘Attention Zones’ at key nodes (such as bus stops, crossing, fitness corners, playgrounds, toilets and plaza areas). These are demarcated by red dotted lines, indicating a shared area for all users.

Within Attention Zones, cyclists and PMD users should slow down and give way to pedestrians.

 As users of the PCN, we would like to have a pleasant and safe experience while travelling. We can do this by being gracious and keep a lookout for each other.
