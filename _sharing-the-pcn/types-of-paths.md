We advise park users to stay on their designated paths. In our parks and along our park connectors, you will encounter these types of paths:



|  | | |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| **Shared Path**    | Red continuous line. Dotted line when approaching attention zone   | ![](/images/Shared%20Path%20Horizontal.png) |


This is shared by all park users, with a maximum speed of 25km/hr. You may see the path being flanked by red continuous or dotted lines (when users approach an Attention Zone).



|  | |  |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| **Segregated / Separated Path**     |      |  ![Alt text for image on Isomer site](/images/Segregated%20%20Separated%20Path.png)   |


At some locations, there are dedicated paths for various PCN users:

Footpaths - for pedestrians, cyclists and personal mobility aid users travelling at slower speeds (not more than 10km/h). Motorised PMDs and PABs are not allowed on the footpath.
Cycling path – for PMD users and cyclists travelling at higher speeds. This path is flanked by continuous or dotted lines (when users approach an Attention Zone) in red, and feature “PCN” imprints or cyclist icons.





|  |  |  |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Attention Zones     |    |     |

Segregated paths may merge into ‘Attention Zones’ at key nodes (such as bus stops, crossing, fitness corners, playgrounds, toilets and plaza areas). These are demarcated by red dotted lines, indicating a shared area for all users.

Within Attention Zones, cyclists and PMD users should slow down and give way to pedestrians.

 As users of the PCN, we would like to have a pleasant and safe experience while travelling. We can do this by being gracious and keep a lookout for each other.

#### Pilot for Revised PCN Typology

|  |  |  |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| To better enhance the user experience along our Park Connector Network, we are piloting a revised park connector typology that will segregate paths into **pedestrians-only paths** and **shared paths** at selected stretches that are sufficiently wide and used primarily for recreation, such as along canals and coastal routes.

| Shared Path | Segregated / Separated Path |  |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| ![Pilot-shared path](/images/pilot-shared%20path.jpeg)    | ![Pilot - segregated path](/images/pilot-segregated%20path.png) 





|  This pilot will be implemented progressively from August 2022 along approximately 30km of park connector paths in: |  |  |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| • Changi Beach Park  |  |  |
| • Changi Bay PC |  |  |
| • Coastal PC |  |  |
| • East Coast Park  |  |  |
| • Pasir Panjang Park  |  |  |

We will review the outcome of the pilot, including public feedback received, before deciding if this revised typology should be refined further and implemented at other park connectors.

Please click on the [FormSG survey link](https://form.gov.sg/63b64b75009b500012c0895d) to share your feedback on the revised typology. Survey findings will help in our ongoing review of the PCN typology.

We will continue to work with LTA and other stakeholders to raise public awareness of good PCN etiquette, so as to provide a more pleasant and safer experience in our PCN and parks.
