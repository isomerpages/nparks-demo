We advise park users to stay on their designated paths. In our parks and along our park connectors, you will encounter these types of paths:

Shared Path

This is shared by all park users, with a maximum speed of 25km/hr. You may see the path being flanked by red continuous or dotted lines (when users approach an Attention Zone).

Segregated / Separated Path

At some locations, there are dedicated paths for various PCN users:

Footpaths -for pedestrians, cyclists and personal mobility aid users travelling at slower speeds (not more than 10km/h). Motorised PMDs and PABs are not allowed on the footpath.
Cycling path – for PMD users and cyclists travelling at higher speeds. This path is flanked by continuous or dotted lines (when users approach an Attention Zone) in red, and feature “PCN” imprints or cyclist icons.

Attention Zones

Segregated paths may merge into ‘Attention Zones’ at key nodes (such as bus stops, crossing, fitness corners, playgrounds, toilets and plaza areas). These are demarcated by red dotted lines, indicating a shared area for all users.

Within Attention Zones, cyclists and PMD users should slow down and give way to pedestrians.

 

Etiquette
To facilitate a pleasant and safe experience, you may also see the following signage. We seek the cooperation of all users to abide by the signs:

Keep left, except when overtaking


Give way to pedestrians


Stay on track and keep to the left of your designated path


Motorised PMDs and PABs to stay within red lines. Do note that motorised PMDs and PABs are not allowed on footpaths

 

When approaching Attention Zones, slow down as there are other users

 
 

If you are a pedestrian, rollerblade user or pet owner…
Be careful when crossing the path, especially in front of an approaching cyclist or PMD user. Keep in mind that cyclists and PMD users need a sufficient distance to slow down and stop. 
When walking or rollerblading at night, wear brightly-coloured clothing to help other see you clearly from a distance. 
Do wear personal protective gear such as helmet or knee guards when rollerblading.
Leash your pet and walk it closer to the edge of the track while keeping yourself between the pet and other users, so that it will not stray into their path.
Always remember to clean up after your pet.
 

If you are riding a bicycle, motorised PMD or PAB…
Do:

Ensure that your device is in good condition and in compliance with LTA's regulations.
Wear protective gear, such as a helmet, for your own safety.
Ride in single file. 
Maintain a safe distance from other users.
Slow down and give way to other users, especially at crowded or narrow areas, and within Attention Zones (red dotted lines).
Remember that pedestrians have the right of way on pedestrian crossings.
Observe and comply with “No riding” signs, if any.
Keep both hands on the handlebars unless signaling. Signal in good time before you make a change in direction. 
Keep your device's lights on when riding at night, to make yourself more visible to other users.

Do not:

Weave along the track.
Overtake others when approaching places such as pedestrian crossings, corners and bends.
Cycle/ride your device in areas where it is not permitted.
