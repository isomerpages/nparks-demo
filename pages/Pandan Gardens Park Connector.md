## Pandan Gardens Park Connector

Extending from West Coast Road to Ulu Pandan Park Connector Bridge, Pandan Gardens Park Connector runs through residential areas and links to the Pandan Reservoir and Pandan Reservoir Fitness Corner.

It is a great place for joggers who want to enjoy a short and comfortable run or even amateur skaters looking for relatively flat terrains.

Pandan Garden Park Connector also joins the Ulu Pandan Park Connector via Singaporeâ€™s first elevated Park Connector bridge (Ulu Pandan Park Connector Bridge).
