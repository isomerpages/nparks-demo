## Tanjong Rhu Promenade

Starting at Tanjong Rhu Bridge along Sungei Geylang, the Tanjong Rhu Promenade leads you along the waterâ€™s edge of Marina Reservoir before bringing you to its endpoint at Gardens by the Bay (Bay East), where stunning views of the Bay South Garden and the Singapore city skyline await you. The promenade plays host to a variety of sporting and recreational activities including dragon boat and kayaking at Kallang Basin and kite-flying and football at the open fields along Tanjong Rhu View and Tanjong Rhu Place.
