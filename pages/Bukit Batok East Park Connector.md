|![Little Guilin](/images/little%20guilin.JPG) Also known as Little Guilin or Xiao Guilin among the locals, this park looks similar to that of Guilin in China - a granite rock sitting within a lake. Two dome shaped shelters give you a fantastic view of the tranquil lake. The towering rock cliffs make a majestic backdrop to the large lake. |
