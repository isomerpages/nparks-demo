## Serangoon PC

Running along Serangoon Reservoir and Sg Pinang, the Serangoon Park Connector is a popular recreational corridor amongst residents living in the vicinity. An established route to Punggol Park, it joins directly to Sungei Serangoon Park Connector via a footbridge across Sg Pinang. Nature lovers will delight in the high biodiversity found here, including the Grey Heron, Little Egret, and conspicuous Collared and White-throated Kingfisher.
