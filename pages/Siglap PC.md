Park users also have the option to rent and return bicycles or rollerblades at any of the Park Connector Network Pit Stops along this park connector, two of which can be found in East Coast Park C4 and Telok Kurau Park. Siglap Park Connector forms the gateway to the Eastern Coastal Loop, allowing park users to cycle towards Tampines Park Connector and Bedok Park Connector which links up to the rest of the loop
