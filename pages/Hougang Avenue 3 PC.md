## Hougang Avenue 3 PC

The 4.4-kilometre Hougang Ave 3 Park Connector is the final piece to the Central Urban Loop (CUL). This park connector connects residents at Hougang and MacPherson to the North-Eastern Riverine Loop via the Serangoon Park Connector, linking them to rustic green pockets such as Coney Island. The Hougang Ave 3 Park Connector also provides Punggol residents with easier access to the Eastern Coastal Loop via the Pelton Canal and Kallang Park Connectors, with a cycling track passing Kallang Riverside Park.
