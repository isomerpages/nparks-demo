## Rower's Bay

Rower’s Bay is part of the 60 km first phase of the&nbsp;[Round Island Route (RIR)](https://www.nparks.gov.sg/sitecore/service/notfound.aspx?item=web%3a%7bB254FFA8-868F-4CED-9A7E-AA05AC86603D%7d%40en). Serving as a rest and gathering point for park users along the RIR, it features a boardwalk that brings visitors closer to the water, a lookout pavilion, swales and a wetland. The wetland around the boardwalk is planted with species that provide food and shelter for native wildlife that can be found in the area, such as the Grey Heron (_Ardea cinerea_) and Copper-cheeked Frog (_Hylarana labialis_). Other amenities at the node include shelters, a toilet and F&amp;B vending machines.
