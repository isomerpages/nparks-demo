## Riverside Park Connector

For visitors&nbsp;coming from Woodlands (Ave 2) Park Connector, Riverside Park Connector leads them onwards along the periphery of [Admiralty Park](https://www.nparks.gov.sg/gardens-parks-and-nature/parks-and-nature-reserves/admiralty-park), bringing them to the western entrance of the park.

Check out&nbsp;the play area at Admiralty Park, which features 26 slides â€“ the largest number of slides in any park Singapore. Those looking for quiet respite may opt to retreat to the nature area of Admiralty Park and check out the mangrove boardwalk.
