## Lorong Halus PC

The 3-kilometer Lorong Halus Park Connector connects the estates of Pasir Ris and Punggol, and runs through the Pasir Ris Farmway which may bring back your nostalgic memories of the nearby old pet and fish farms. It also serves as the green corridor link between Pasir Ris Park and Coney Island Park, bringing park users to explore the rusticity of the eastern side of Singapore. 

Park users can have the opportunity to admire the scenic view of the Serangoon Reservoir and Lorong Halus Wetlands as they stroll or cycle through the park connector. Birdwatching enthusiasts can also choose to drop by Lorong Halus Wetlands and spend a fruitful day there spotting many bird species, including the Chestnut Munias and Little Grebes.
