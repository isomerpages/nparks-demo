## Lornie PC

[Para 1] Located along Lornie Road, the 1.76 km long Lornie Park Connector is part of the Lornie Nature Corridor that comprises a&nbsp;[Nature Way](https://www.nparks.gov.sg/gardens-parks-and-nature/nature-ways), a&nbsp;[Park Connector](https://www.nparks.gov.sg/gardens-parks-and-nature/park-connector-network), and abuts the&nbsp;[Central Catchment Nature Reserve](https://www.nparks.gov.sg/gardens-parks-and-nature/parks-and-nature-reserves/central-catchment-nature-reserve).

Lornie Nature Corridor, which buffers the nature reserve, showcases reclamation of the old Lornie Road for greenery and recreation, restoration of nature, and rewilding to create a more naturalistic landscape. The planting verges on both sides of the road are planted up with more than 100 species of trees and shrubs in a multi-tiered manner that mimics a rainforest. In time, this will result in a forested corridor, restoring nature into the highly urbanised area.

The Lornie Nature Corridor also strengthens the ecological resilience of the abutting Central Catchment Nature Reserve by protecting the forest edge against the impacts of drying and wind. This buffer would also make our nature reserve forests more resilient to the effects of climate change such as extreme weather conditions.

This park connector is also part of the&nbsp;[Coast-to-Coast (C2C) Trail](https://www.nparks.gov.sg/sitecore/service/notfound.aspx?item=web%3a%7b0F87E3B3-29A2-43ED-8F66-25D42910891F%7d%40en), and provides people with recreational opportunities amidst nature. <br>
