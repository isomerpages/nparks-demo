## Punggol PC

Running along Punggol reservoir and the Straits of Johor, this 6.1 km water-themed park connector links Punggol Promenade to Gerald Drive. Completed and opened to the public in 2010, it not only improves accessibility but also enhances biodiversity in the area, featuring a variety of birds including the majestic Grey Heron, migratory Little Egret and the commonly seen Collared Kingfisher.

This park connector also joins Punggol Waterway and passes Anchorvale Community Club, Sengkang Sports Complex and Singaporeâ€™s largest man-made wetland, Sengkang Floating Wetland, before ending at Gerald Drive.
