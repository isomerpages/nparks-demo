## Bedok PC

Starting at Bedok Reservoir Park near Jalan Lembah Bedok, Bedok Park Connector ends at the underpass behind Bedok Camp, in the direction of East Coast Park. Here, you can enjoy scenic views of Bedok Reservoir along the park connector, which also provides an alternative route linking you to East Coast Park from Bedok Reservoir Park or vice versa. Our Park Connector Network Pit Stop at East Coast Park Area G offers you two recreational options â€“ cycling or roller blading.

A new stretch of Bedok PC, near NEWater, has been partially completed. It is connected to Bedok Ria Crescent Playground and the western bank of Bedok PC via a footbridge.
