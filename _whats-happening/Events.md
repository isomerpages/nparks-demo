#### About the event

Get ready to go green and become an environmental hero with #TOGOECO2023 - the virtual challenge that's all about saving the planet! This year's theme is "From Zero to Hero," and we want you to be part of the action.

  

Earth Day has been around since 1970, but this year, we're taking things to the next level. We've set a Finisher goal of 53 kilometers in honor of Earth Day's 53rd anniversary. That's 53 kilometers of making a difference and taking a step towards a better future.

  

So, what are you waiting for? Join us in the #TOGOECO2023 challenge and let's make a difference together!
