<p>Giving way to pedestrians along the path? Helping an elderly at the intersection?
Kindness goes a long way on our trails and on the Park Connector Network
(PCN)!</p>
<p>The PCN Kindness Challenge is back again with style! Together with Singapore
Kindness Movement (SKM), we are calling out to users of our Parks and PCN
to join us in spreading graciousness and kindness on our Park Connectors.
😊</p>
<p>Up for a challenge? Spot the Singa on the PCN! Gain some points by capturing
AR icons of Singa and Phyl when using the NParks Explore a Route (NEAR)
Mobile application! Accumulate points on the app and stand a chance to
win grocery vouchers as well as merchandise from Singapore Kindness Movement.
Top 3 winners will win $200 grocery voucher, a limited edition Singa plushie
and other SKM merchandise. ✌🏻</p>
