#### Pilot for Revised PCN Typology Phase 2
<br>

To better enhance the user experience along our Park Connector Network (PCN), the National Parks Board (NParks) started piloting a revised PCN typology in September 2022 that segregates selected stretches of the PCN into pedestrian-only paths (POP) and shared paths (SP). NParks also enhanced the clarity of paths through newly designed ground imprints that clearly reflect the user groups allowed on each path, as well as the user group that is accorded priority within each path. <br><br> Phase 1 of the revised PCN typology pilot was implemented between 2022 and 2023 for approximately 30km of park connectors along the Round-Island-Route Eastern Coastal Corridor and Pasir Panjang Park. <br><br>NParks will be implementing Phase 2 of the pilot progressively from along approximately 20km of park connector paths in: <br>

*   Tanjong Rhu PC, Gardens by the Bay, Marina Barrage, Singapore River Promenade
*   Punggol PC
*   Pasir Ris Park
*   Ulu Sembawang PC

<br>

| Shared Path | Segregated / Separated Path |  |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| ![Pilot-shared path](/images/pilot-shared%20path.jpeg)    | ![Pilot - segregated path](/images/pilot-segregated%20path.png) 

<br>

Based on surveys and feedback, NParks has further improved the clarity of the ground imprints by including directional arrows for Phase 2. These complement the "Keep Left" PCN etiquette and guide users on which side of the path they should be using when moving in different directions. &nbsp;NParks will continue to work with LTA and other stakeholders to raise public awareness on the revised PCN typology and encourage good PCN etiquette.

<br>

NParks will review the outcome of the pilot, including public feedback received, before deciding if this revised typology should be refined further and implemented at other park connectors.

### Visioning the North-South Corridor

![rochor_sungei road](/images/rochor_sungei%20road%20v1.jpg)

The 21.5km North-South Corridor (NSC) is a multi-modal transportation corridor that will enhance connectivity from the northern region to the city, serving towns such as Sembawang, Yishun, Ang Mo Kio, Toa Payoh, Novena and Rochor.

The NSC also forms part of the 34 km Central Corridor, which is one of the island-wide recreational routes that NParks is curating to enable Singaporeans to be immersed in greenery and have more opportunities to explore our island and its green spaces. The Central Corridor is a key spine that will link recreational users to the Round-Island-Route, Coast-to Coast Trails and various other parks and park connectors.

The Land Transport Authority (LTA) and National Parks Board (NParks) will be seeking public views on how the surface streets that will be freed up with the NSC can be enhanced further for accessibility, greenery, and recreational use by pedestrians, cyclists, commuters, and local communities.

#### Co-creating the NSC together!

To garner views and ideas for designing these accessibility, recreational features and amenities for community spaces, LTA and NParks has co-organised a series of public engagement workshops in various regions across the corridor over a period of about six months since July 2023.

#### The workshop sessions have been concluded. Thank you for your participation!

## Pilot PCN Typology



------

To better enhance the user experience along our Park Connector Network, we are piloting a revised park connector typology that will segregate paths into **pedestrians-only paths** and **shared paths** on selected stretches that are sufficiently wide and used primarily for recreation, such as along canals and coastal routes.

| Shared Path | Segregated / Separated Path |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ![Pilot-shared path](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isomerpages/nparks-pcn/staging/images/pilot-shared%20path.jpeg) | ![Pilot - segregated path](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isomerpages/nparks-pcn/staging/images/pilot-segregated%20path.png) |  |

| This pilot will be implemented progressively from August 2022 along approximately 30km of park connector paths in: |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| •&nbsp;Changi Beach Park |  |  |
| •&nbsp;Changi Bay PC |  |  |
| •&nbsp;Coastal PC |  |  |
| •&nbsp;East Coast Park |  |  |
| •&nbsp;Pasir Panjang Park |  |  |

We will review the outcome of the pilot, including public feedback received, before deciding if this revised typology should be refined further and implemented at other park connectors.

##### The survey below has been closed. Thank you for your participation!
