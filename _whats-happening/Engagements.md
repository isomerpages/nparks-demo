## Pilot PCN Typology
To better enhance the user experience along our Park Connector Network, we are piloting a revised park connector typology that will segregate paths into **pedestrians-only paths**</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong style="box-sizing: border-box; font-family: Lato; border-width: 0px; border-style: solid; border-color: var(--chakra-colors-gray-200); overflow-wrap: break-word; font-weight: bold; color: rgb(72, 72, 72);">**shared paths** selected stretches that are sufficiently wide and used primarily for recreation, such as along canals and coastal routes.

| Shared Path | Segregated / Separated Path |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ![Pilot-shared path](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isomerpages/nparks-pcn/staging/images/pilot-shared%20path.jpeg) | ![Pilot - segregated path](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isomerpages/nparks-pcn/staging/images/pilot-segregated%20path.png) |  |

| This pilot will be implemented progressively from August 2022 along approximately 30km of park connector paths in: |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| • Changi Beach Park |  |  |
| • Changi Bay PC |  |  |
| • Coastal PC |  |  |
| • East Coast Park |  |  |
| • Pasir Panjang Park |  |  |

We will review the outcome of the pilot, including public feedback received, before deciding if this revised typology should be refined further and implemented at other park connectors.
