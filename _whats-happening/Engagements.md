## Pilot PCN Typology




![PCN Pilot Typology poster](/images/Poster_PCNPilotTypologySurvey.png)


------

To better enhance the user experience along our Park Connector Network, we are piloting a revised park connector typology that will segregate paths into **pedestrians-only paths** and **shared paths** on selected stretches that are sufficiently wide and used primarily for recreation, such as along canals and coastal routes.

| Shared Path | Segregated / Separated Path |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ![Pilot-shared path](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isomerpages/nparks-pcn/staging/images/pilot-shared%20path.jpeg) | ![Pilot - segregated path](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isomerpages/nparks-pcn/staging/images/pilot-segregated%20path.png) |  |

| This pilot will be implemented progressively from August 2022 along approximately 30km of park connector paths in: |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| • Changi Beach Park |  |  |
| • Changi Bay PC |  |  |
| • Coastal PC |  |  |
| • East Coast Park |  |  |
| • Pasir Panjang Park |  |  |

We will review the outcome of the pilot, including public feedback received, before deciding if this revised typology should be refined further and implemented at other park connectors.
